# This is a simple program to run simple operations like addition , multiplication , division and subtraction

x = float(x)
print ("this is the result of addition ")
print (x)
   
y = (a-b)
y = float(y)
print ("this is the result of subtraction ")
print (y)

z = (a*b)
z = float(z)
print ("this is the result of multiplication ")
print (z)

k = (a/b)
k = float(k)
print ("this is the result of division ")
print (k)
